    <h1>Black Holes</h1>
    <p>A black hole is a region in spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from
        it. This
        phenomenon is characterized by a boundary called the event horizon, beyond which any object or information is
        inexorably
        drawn toward the central point known as the singularity, where spacetime curvature becomes infinite according to
        general
        relativity. Black holes are classified based on properties like mass, charge, and angular momentum, and they
        play a
        crucial role in our understanding of astrophysics and the nature of spacetime.</p>

    <h2>Formation and Characteristics of Black Holes</h2>
    <p>The formation of black holes is intricately linked to the gravitational collapse of massive stars, leading to
        singularities with infinite density. General relativity plays a pivotal role, predicting key features like event
        horizonsâ€”boundaries beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. Gravitational effects, time dilation, and
        unique
        characteristics define these enigmatic celestial entities.</p>

    <h3>Stellar Collapse Mechanism</h3>
    <p>The stellar collapse mechanism involves the gravitational collapse of a massive star, leading to the formation of
        a
        black hole when the core cannot withstand gravitational forces.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <h4>Event Horizon</h4>
    <p>The event horizon is a boundary where escape becomes impossible.</p>

    <h5>Definition and Boundary</h5>
    <h6>Formation of Event Horizon</h6>
    <p>The formation of the event horizon occurs during the gravitational collapse of massive stars, marking the
        boundary
        beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the immense gravitational pull of a black hole.</p>
    <h6>Characteristics of Boundary</h6>
    <p>The boundary of the event horizon in a black hole possesses unique characteristics. It marks the point beyond
        which
        escape is impossible, defining the region where gravitational forces prevent light and matter from returning.
    </p>

    <h5>Gravitational Effects</h5>
    <p>The gravitational effects of the event horizon are profound, shaping the behavior of nearby matter and
        influencing the
        fabric of spacetime. As objects approach the event horizon, gravitational forces intensify, causing time
        dilation and
        distorting trajectories. Once crossed, nothing, not even light, can escape the overwhelming gravitational pull,
        defining
        the point of no return in black hole physics.</p>

    <h2>Observational Discoveries</h2>
    <p>Observational discoveries of black holes have transformed astrophysics. Gravitational wave detections by LIGO and
        Virgo
        marked a breakthrough, capturing the ripples in spacetime from black hole mergers. The Event Horizon Telescope's
        image
        of Messier 87's black hole provided the first visual evidence, unveiling the mysterious nature of these cosmic
        entities
        and advancing our understanding.</p>
