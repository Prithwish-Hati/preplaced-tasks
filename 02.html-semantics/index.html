            <p>A pen is a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_tool">writing instrument</a> that
                applies
                ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or
                drawing.<sup>[1]</sup> Early pens
                such as reed pens, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill">quill</a> pens, dip pens and ruling
                pens
                held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small
                void or cavity
                that had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an <a

            <aside>
                <p>One interesting fact about Pens:<br>
                    The smallest pen in the world is the "Nanofountain Probe", which scientists use for nanoscale
                    on-chip
                    patterning. The
                    lines this device produces are only 40 nanometers wide.
                <p>
            </aside>
            <p>
                Today,
                such pens find only a
                small number of specialized uses, such as in <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration">illustration</a> and calligraphy. Reed pens, quill
                pens and dip
                pens, which
                were used for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porous_point_pen">ceramic tip</a>
                pens.<sup>[4]</sup> Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"></a>cartography, have been replaced
                by technical pens such
                as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotring#Products"></a>Rapidograph.<sup>[5]</sup> All of
                these
                modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, such that they
                do not need to be dipped
                in ink while writing.<sup>[6]</sup>

            <p>A reed pen (Greek: κάλαμοι kalamoi; singular κάλαμος kalamos) is a writing implement made by cutting
                and shaping a
                single reed straw or length of bamboo.</p>

                A dip pen is a writing instrument used to apply ink to paper. It usually consists of a metal nib with
                capillary channels
                like those of fountain pen nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials can
                be used for the
                holder, including bone, metal and plastic; some pens are made entirely of glass.
